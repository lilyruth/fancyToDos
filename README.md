# To-Do App with a little flair


Going a little beyond a normal to-do app, this to-do app takes in both input and priority, returning the next to-do item and then displaying the remaining to-do items. 

Progress can be saved with a login. 


=> How to load to-dos from database/server using thunk?? Upon login state is initialized to the to-dos? 

=> Get API functionality with the weather widget set up first. 

=> validation both client & server side

=> reset input field

=> server side API proxy

=> database for saving the to-dos, username, password

=> authentication, JWT token

=> remove package.json proxy before deploying, the proxy is just for development

=> login component needs to be replaced with logout component if logged in (conditional render)

=> Mobile responsive: stack login and weather, reduce footer font size, increase padding-bottom for main
