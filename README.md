# To-Do App with a little flair


Going a little beyond a normal to-do app, this to-do app takes in both input and priority, returning the next to-do item and then displaying the remaining to-do items. 

Progress can be saved with a login. 

=> Need to add delete function

=> How to load to-dos from database/server?? Upon login state is initialized to the to-dos? 

=> Get API functionality with the weather widget set up first. 

=> validation

=> server side API

=> database for saving the to-dos, username, password

=> authentication, JWT token

=> add zenquotes with proxy ????
